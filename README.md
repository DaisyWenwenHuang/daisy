- In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf.:full_moon_with_face:
- one Sunday morning the warm sun came up and pip! out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry coderpillar.:four_leaf_clover:
- she started to look for some python libraries.
- On Monday she ate through one Numpy. But she was still hungry.
- On Tuesday she ate through two pandas, but she was still hungry.
- On wednesday she ate through three Matplotlib, but she was still hungry.
- On Thursday she ate through four Plotly, but she was still hungry.
- On Friday she ate through five Scipy, but she was still hungry.
- On Saturday she ate through one Scikit-Learn, one piece of TensoFlow, one seaborn, one OpenCV and one slice of TensorFlow.
- That night she had a stomachache!
- The next day was Sunday again. The coderpillar ate through one nice green data, and after that she felt much better.
- Now she wasn't hungry anymore and she wasn't a little coderpillar anymore.
- she was a big, fat coderpillar.
- she built a small house, called a cocoon, around herself. 
- she stayed inside for more than two years.
- Then she nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed her way out...
- she wanted to be a beautiful butterfly!
